# V Wrapper for the Raylib C framework, version 3.5.0

currently works for [v 2.1.0](https://github.com/vlang/v/releases/tag/0.2.1)

## Dev Notes

- Dropped Files and Directory Files are ignored until I get a sensible way to get it to work with `v`
- Ignoring String Manipulation methods in favor for native V string manipulation
